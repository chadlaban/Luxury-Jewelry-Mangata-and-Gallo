              Mariana, the owner and lead designer, is an Austin local who is
              highly regarded for her unique jewelry designs. After graduating
              from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting and
              metal smithing, Mariana opened the first Mangata & Gallo store in
              her hometown. She grew her business online, expanding her reach to
              clients looking for exceptional jewelry for their special moments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, Mariana has managed every aspect of the business,
              from designing jewelry to handling marketing and running the
              e-commerce platform. Recently, she has brought on board several
              talented artisans to help craft her designs, along with a new team
              member to manage the companyâ€™s website and social media accounts.
